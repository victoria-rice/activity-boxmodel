        <p>Tank Girl is a British comic created by Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin. Originally drawn by Jamie Hewlett, it has also been drawn by Philip Bond, Glyn Dillon, Ashley Wood, Warwick Johnson-Cadwell, Jim Mahfood, Rufus Dayglo, Andy Pritchett, and Mike McMahon. The eponymous character Tank Girl drives a tank, which is also her home. She undertakes a series of missions for a nebulous organization before making a serious mistake and being declared an outlaw for her sexual inclinations and her substance abuse. The comic centres on her misadventures with her boyfriend, Booga, a mutant kangaroo. The comic's style was heavily influenced by punk visual art, and strips were frequently deeply disorganized, anarchic, absurdist, and psychedelic. The strip features various elements with origins in surrealist techniques, fanzines, collage, cut-up technique, stream of consciousness, and metafiction, with very little regard or interest for conventional plot or committed narrative.
The strip was initially set in a stylized post-apocalyptic Australia,[1] although it drew heavily from contemporary British pop culture.</p>

        <p>The comic was also adapted into a critically and financially unsuccessful film, albeit with a considerable cult following. The film featured Lori Petty as Tank Girl and Naomi Watts as Jet Girl.
Martin and Hewlett are known for speaking poorly of the experience, with Martin calling it "a bit of a sore point" for them.[7] Despite its critics, the film did however undeniably broaden the comics' fanbase from a relatively modest cult following to an international audience.</p>
     
        <p>So overall is it a bad movie? Sadly, yes but it’s a bad movie that at least features some bold choices, a bucket-load of personality and in Lori Petty a real go-for-broke performance. Anyone who watches ‘Tank Girl’ will see a hundred different reasons as to why it failed. They will also be perplexed, engaged and entertained and after all, one ambitious failure is worth a hundred mediocre play-it-safe blockbusters.</p>
